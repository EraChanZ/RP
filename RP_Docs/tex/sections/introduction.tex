\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduce the topic and explain why it is important (what is the motivation to conduct your research?).

\item Relate to the most relevant existing work from the literature, explain their contributions, and (critically) indicate what questions are still unanswered.

\item Explain what the research questions for this work are; this usually is a subset of the unanswered questions.

\item Summarize the main contributions or conclusions of this research.
NB: Make sure the title of your paper matches the main research question, contribution, or conclusion.

\item Briefly indicate how the rest of the paper fits together to answer your research question(s).
\end{itemize}

For a longer research paper, a section with a more elaborate discussion of the literature may follow, but for short (conference) submissions, this is often included in the introduction.

Make sure the introduction and conclusion are easily understandable by everyone with a BSc in computer science (your examiner may have a completely different expertise).
